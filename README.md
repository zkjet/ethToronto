### Initial Setup

1. [Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
2. [Add Moonbase Alpha Network to MetaMask via the Button at the Top of Page](https://docs.moonbeam.network/)
3. [Get funds from the faucet](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbase-alpha/faucet/)
4. [Swap some (not all) DEV tokens for xcUNITS](https://moonbeam-swap.netlify.app/#/swap)
5. [Download and Install Polkadot JS Extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
6. Create an Account in the Polkadot JS Extension and Select *allow use on any chain*

### Perform a Cross Chain Swap via XCM
1. [Head to Moonbeam Apps](https://apps.moonbeam.network/moonbase-alpha/)
2. Transfer 1 xcUNIT token to the Moonbase Relay Chain. Verify arrival by heading to [Moonbase Relay Polkadot JS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Ffrag-moonbase-relay-rpc-ws.g.moonbase.moonbeam.network#/accounts)
3. Transfer some of the xcUNIT token from the Moonbase Relay Chain back to Moonbase Alpha.
4. I will make a sample XCM Transfer of DOT from Polkadot to Moonbeam. You can find the exact transaction hash and transfer details here: https://polkaholic.io/chains/#xcmtransfers. Once you have found the txn, click on extrinsic details.
5. Using the transaction hash that you found in the prior step, look up the transaction details on [Polkadot Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/)
